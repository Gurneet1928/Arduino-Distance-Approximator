###

A simple project, which uses Ultrasonic Sensor and 10 LEDs to approximate the distance between sensor and object.
With the help of Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04, we firstly get the distance.
Then based on this distance, we switch ON/OFF the LEDs as required.

### Components Used:

 1. Arduino UNO
 2. LEDs - 3 Red, 3 Green and 4 White
 3. Resistors - 300ohm, but anything works as long as LEDs work
 4. Jumper Wires
 5. Breadboard
 6. Soldering Machine (Optional)
 7. Solder PCB (optional)

### Final Verdict:
A pretty easy and simple project, good for beginners. Doesn't require any display. Make sure to check code and tinker with it to find something new.
